- **Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)** tailored for ATC environments.
- **Natural Language Understanding (NLU)** for instruction classification.
- **Natural Language Generation (NLG)** for automated, context-aware responses.
- **Real-time data processing** and advanced noise-cancellation techniques.

## Technologies

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Frameworks and Libraries**: TensorFlow, NLP frameworks, XLSR-Wav2Vec2

## Use Cases

- Enhancing ATC communication
- Real-time safety monitoring
- Improving aviation efficiency
